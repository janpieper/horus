Horus is a library that extracts an anonymous function's code and creates a
standalone version of it in a new module at runtime.

The goal is to have a storable and transferable function which does not depend
on the availability of the module that defined it.

## How does it work?

To achieve that goal, Horus extracts the assembly code of the anonymous
function and creates a standalone Erlang module based on it. This module can be
stored, transfered to another Erlang node and executed anywhere without the
presence of the initial anonymous function's module.

## Project maturity

Horus is still under active development and should be considered *Alpha* at
this stage.

## Getting started

### Add as a dependency

Add Horus as a dependency of your project:

Using Rebar:

```erlang
%% In rebar.config
{deps, [{horus, "0.2.2"}]}.
```

Using Erlang.mk:

```make
# In your Makefile
DEPS += horus
dep_horus = hex 0.2.2
```

Using Mix:

```elixir
# In mix.exs
defp deps do
  [
    :horus, "0.2.2"}
  ]
end
```

### Extract an anonymous function

To extract an anonymous function, use `horus:to_standalone_fun/1`:

```erlang
Fun = fun() ->
          do_something_fancy()
      end,

StandaloneFun = horus:to_standalone_fun(Fun).
```

It works with references to regular functions are well:

```erlang
Log = fun logger:info/2,

StandaloneLog = horus:to_standalone_fun(Log).
```

### Execute a standalone function

Once extracted, the function can be stored as an Erlang binary, or transfered
to a remote Erlang node. You then use `horus:exec/2` to execute it:

```erlang
receive
    {standalone_fun, StandaloneLog} ->
        horus:exec(
          StandaloneLog,
          ["~p received and executed function", [self()]])
end.
```
